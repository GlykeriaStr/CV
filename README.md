I am a junior full stack developer and graduate of Makers Academy. I value clean, readable and well tested code. In a previous life I was an actor in a CoronaVirus world, so I decided to take my future into my hands and started my coding journey. After a short period of self-learning I signed up with Makers Academy to help me towards my professional debut in the tech industry.

## Skills

#### **Communication**

Providing excellent customer service means being able to communicate effectively by showing interest and carefully listening to the customer's needs. These skills have helped me throughout my working life and I was able to apply them within teams at Makers. Being able to vocalise my needs but also listen to others to create an effective and supportive team environment.

#### **Growth mindset**

I believe in hard work and persistence. That's why I did a lot of self-learning coding before I joined Makers and this skill has only grown since being a part of Makers community. I value feedback as a learning tool, and I was asking for it from my teammates and pairing partners as well as my coaches. I embrace a challenge and I consistently try to improve and learn something new. Since I was little, I always loved learning. I taught myself how to play the guitar and I learned to speak English, French and Italian, after living in Italy for 6 months.

#### **Fast Learner**

In the hospitality industry, I was faced with a lot of environments and situations I was unfamiliar with and had to adapt quickly.

Being an actor it was imperative I was a fast learner. I would consistently have a short amount of time to not only come off script but research the roles I played and apply this knowledge in a true and effective manner. This skill has been practiced and tested at makers with a constant abundance of knowledge but I have taken it all on board and consistently produced projects I am proud of that reflect my ability to absorb knowledge quickly and in intense situations.

In one of my Front of House positions I was trusted after only a few months on the job with as technical support for a VR room.
