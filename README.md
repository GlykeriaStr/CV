I am a junior back end developer and graduate of Makers Academy. I value clean, readable and well tested code. In a previous life I was an actor in a CoronaVirus world, so I decided to take my future into my hands and started my coding journey. After a short period of self-learning I signed up with Makers Academy to help me towards my professional debut in the tech industry.
